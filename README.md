# AerialCarRecognition
I have chosen to create a dataset that will aid in classifying images with cars using Aerial imaging of Stirling and Edinburgh as my two cities (the M2 option).
This is a solo project.

The goal is to feed satellite images into the model and have it identify if the image is a car or not. 
This could be challenging as from above as anything that looks rectangular or more vibrantly coloured may be identified as a car by mistake.
